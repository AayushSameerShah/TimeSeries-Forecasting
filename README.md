# TimeSeries-Forecasting
*If you know machine learning, then it is a breeze. If you don't, then you will.*

### 🐤 Background
This time, I just took it. Took a challenge to learn it. This topic was being posponded since the start. I thought *will learn, will learn sometime* because it didn't sound much exciting to me *(or say, I was worried about its complexity without learning it)*.

Finally took an opportunity and got started. And believe me, it amazed me. Like *what*!? Time-series forecasting ***is*** amazing. And again, if you know machine learning algorithms, then it will be so helpful for you.

### 📑 Structure
As always *(if you're fimiliar with my past human-understandable courses)* this course will help you our from the scratch to understand the nuts and bolts of time-series expecting you are fimiliar with python (numpy and pandas).

Kindly start from the folder `0. Me Greeting Me` and follow your way through the course ending with the folder `7. See ya`. I have tried to keep the language reader friendly with many *(believe me, many)* kiddy stuff inside trying to make it as digestable as possible *(even the maths!)*.

> Kind note: I have chosen the **theme** of this course as if I were writing a ***note*** to myself in the future. That might or might not interest you about the details, but you might want to place your story in there!

### 🔡 About
The base, the instructor, the guru of my course is **Mr. Lazyprogrammer**. This was my first interaction with his course, but he is AMAZING. The beauty and expertize that he delievers is fascinating. 

Many of the simplification given in the course are coming from him, altough with some modification to match our mood and writing style. You can checkout his course on Udemy.

So, whenever I mention "an author", I am refering to the legend Lazyprogrammer.

> **Disclaimer**: I have made this course only as a part to educate myself and anyone who is reading this. Taking the original course is appriciated. This GitHub course covers most of the lecture material *(with given credits)* in the simplified manner. Hope reader understands my intent 🙏


*Learning means doing. Read it as a story, practice it as a real life*
