# ðŸ˜‡ Finally.
*Long time, great stuff, amazing practice.*

If you've *(dear reader)* followed through this course, it has been a long journey.

I started this course in **May** and ending it in **October**. It should have been completed by at least July but *nah*, because of some other courses, and projects I wasn't able to do so. I feel like *something* now. When started, I **didn't** know a bit about time-series. And now, I can *at least* confidently talk on it.

Thanks to this course, which covers many areas of this topic, I am able to read *(so can you!)* a new material to advance my knowledge. It would be amazing if I could be in the Matrix and just install a file called `"time-series.skill"` in a matter of seconds. But this isn't the movie, but the matrix that we're living in, so stuff has to be learnt by repetation.

Fine. <br>
Many topics have been learnt. But now, forgotten. And that's why this whole repository is here! ***Whenever you want***, just come to the relevant sections and open up the flash cards. There you go!

# Next up?
*You didn't expect this question here, did you?*

I am thinking to go with either an ML course on coursera or... mhmm... let's go with some DL course as it is fresh now. I don't know, you will see.
