    "Agreed. ACF and PACF *(also Dicky-test)* help use a lot deciding the `p`, `d` and `q`  values *(not respectively)*. But **the model is not guerenteed to be the most optimal model**. We usually get the best but that model can be said to be \"sub-optimal\" model. Thus, we can leave this job for the computer to do and after getting that *initial* sub-optimal model we can continue making that a better model tuining the parameters according to our needs.\n",
